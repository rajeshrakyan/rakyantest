Mandy (9/11/2020, 7:13:30 PM): Hello!  My name is Mandy.  How can I help you today? 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:13:38 PM): Hi 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:13:56 PM): We have a website agqa.com on amazon web service, which we want to shift to yours as managed vps 
Mandy (9/11/2020, 7:14:54 PM): Hi Rajesh! Sure thing, sounds good. What CMS is your website based on? 
Mandy (9/11/2020, 7:15:11 PM): And do you have a timeframe for moving over? We can migrate you for free. 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:15:12 PM): It is a custom built on .net framework 2.0 and MsSQl server database 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:15:32 PM): It also uses some third part controls from Telerik 
Mandy (9/11/2020, 7:17:22 PM): Thank you for the info, Rajesh. How soon do you need your server up? Because we do have Windows VPS plans? 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:18:18 PM): We need as as possible. But we first want to make sure about migration issues. Please note that there is a cron job too which emails reports every night, so you will need to configure the scheduler too 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:19:05 PM): At present we are using around 160 gb of space and need to free cache folders every 15 days 
Mandy (9/11/2020, 7:19:51 PM): You will be able to schedule and arrange everything with our team. Both migration and anything related to technical support. We are available for you 24/7. 
Mandy (9/11/2020, 7:20:35 PM): Migration usually takes 2-7 days but your site will be live the whole time except when the final sync occurs but, as previously stated, you will arrange and test everything with our team. 
Mandy (9/11/2020, 7:21:12 PM): From everything you said, regarding disk space I mean, our 16GB RAM VPS will be a good fit for you because it has 200GB SSD. 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:21:41 PM): ok, do you have a regular disk plan too ? 
Mandy (9/11/2020, 7:23:00 PM): 16 GB RAM
8 vCPU
200 GB SSD Disk Space
10 TB Bandwidth
Windows
Plesk Onyx
+ Free 100GB Backup
$219/mo 
Mandy (9/11/2020, 7:23:09 PM): Can you please elaborate on that a bit further? 
Mandy (9/11/2020, 7:23:19 PM): What do you mean by regular disk plan? 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:23:40 PM): I mean if you have a plan with normal hard disk instead of SSD 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:23:55 PM): to bring down the cost 
Mandy (9/11/2020, 7:25:03 PM): Oh, I see. SSD is the only option on VPS. Are you maybe interested in dedicated server? 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:25:33 PM): Dedicated Server probably will be more costly. And we also need a managed server 
Mandy (9/11/2020, 7:27:59 PM): Of course, we will give you a fully-managed service. Rajesh, would it be okay if I connect you with our senior agent for further assistance? 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:28:13 PM): Sure 
Mandy (9/11/2020, 7:29:52 PM): Joe is available and he'd be happy to assist. He's an expert. Please give him a moment to review our chat. 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:30:09 PM): Sure 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:30:11 PM): Hello!  My name is Joe.  How can I help you today? 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:30:30 PM): We have a website agqa.com on amazon web service, which we want to shift to yours as managed vps 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:30:48 PM): It is a custom built on .net framework 2.0 and MsSQl server database 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:30:51 PM): Hello there Rajesh! looks like you want to setup a Windows VPS - sure thing we can migrate that ovr 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:31:02 PM): oh 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:31:48 PM): so we can do that- as far as .net framework and can have support assist as well with the MSSQL DB -we would be able to provide MSSQL Express Edition 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:31:49 PM): 2019 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:32:34 PM): We have to see if the existing codes work fine in 2019 or not. Ideally it should unless the coder has used some part of code which has been deprecated 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:32:42 PM): or we can use 2016- 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:32:46 PM): Which hosting plan you suggest ? 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:33:12 PM): well- it depends on your applications and what you are running- and how much disk space you require 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:33:21 PM): do you know how much RAM and disk space you may need ? 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:33:33 PM): At present we are using AWS and disk space we have is 170gb 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:33:56 PM): are you currently using Plesk as well? 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:34:15 PM): No we use RDP to manage , which needs to change. We want a managed server 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:34:46 PM): oh ok- you would still have 2 free RDP licenses included if you want to activate that - support can assist 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:35:06 PM): to have a fully managed server- we would need a control panel on the server- in this case Plesk - 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:35:20 PM): Also, then we can assist with migration as well 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:35:40 PM): and now let me look at the 170GB or close - for space 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:36:06 PM): I know Mandy had mentioned a VPS - is that the direction you are leaning? 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:36:18 PM): in that case to  get close to your space requirements you have : 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:36:27 PM): https://www.liquidweb.com/products/vps/ 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:36:38 PM): she later suggested a dedicated managed server and then handed over to you 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:37:02 PM): I would recommend a dedicated server as well-still have admin access for you- and have more resources and it is your own server 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:37:32 PM): let me look at an entry level Windows dedicated server- I can also discount this server we choose at 40% off for the first 3 months to help with cost- 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:37:48 PM): as you migrate/test and approve - no contracts and is month to month 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:38:22 PM): are you ok with Windows OS 2019 Standard? 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:38:29 PM): 64-bit 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:38:36 PM): or we can do 2016 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:38:54 PM): I think so , our main aim is that site in .net framework 2.0 should work without any issues as it is working now 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:39:32 PM): we would be able to migrate then you can test and approve-before we point the DNS to the new server.  As you test and approve with us- your site remains online with your current provider and server 
Joe (9/11/2020, 7:39:45 PM): so we'll make sure all works before the final sync 
Me (9/11/2020, 7:40:02 PM): That sounds great. So please point me to a plan that will be suitable for us
